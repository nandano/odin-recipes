    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheat Flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cup water and mix until it's lump free, the chunks of flour have dissolved, and the batter has a good consistency, adding more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a griddle over medium heat. Pour some of the batter onto the griddle; spread the batter in a circular motion, slowly yet steadily. Cook until the edges start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the grill. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil between each batch.</li>
