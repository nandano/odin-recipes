    <p>Chilli Paneer is a vegetarian version of Chilli Chicken and has become one of the most sought after dishes in Indo-Chinese cuisine. I have been told that it tastes similar to General Tso’s recipe, though it is made with Indian cottage cheese instead of tofu.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Paneer (Cottage Cheeze)</li>
        <li>Maida</li>
        <li>Ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Kashmiri Chilli Powder</li>

        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Green Chilli</li>
        <li>Chopped spring onions</li>
        <li>Capsicum</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Red chilli sauce</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl take 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida).</li>
        <li>Next add ½ teaspoon ginger paste and ½ teaspoon garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper or black pepper powder and ¼ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Next add ¼ cup water or add as required. With a wired whisk or a spoon mix very well to get a smooth batter without any lumps. The batter is of medium consistency.</li>
        <li>Add paneer cubes in the batter. With a spoon, gently coat the paneer cubes with the batter.</li>
        <li>Fry these cubes of paneer in a frying pan</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add 2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger, 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic and 2 to 3 green chillies (slit or sliced).</li>
        <li>Stir fry on medium to high heat for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then add ⅓ cup chopped spring onions (scallions). Stir fry spring onions for 1 to 2 minutes on medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>Next add ½ cup sliced capsicum.</li>
        <li>Stir fry on medium to high heat for 3 to 4 minutes. The capsicum only needs to slightly cooked.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and then add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or sweet paprika.</li>
        <li>Then add 2 teaspoons soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Next add 1 teaspoon red chilli sauce. The red chilli sauce has to be spicy.</li>
        <li>Stir and mix the sauces and red chilli powder with the remaining stir fried ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add ½ to ⅔ cup water.</li>
        <li>Mix well.</li>
        <li>Let the chilli sauce mixture come to a simmer on medium to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add cornstarch and maida and mix well to make a fine paste without any lumps and add this paste to the sauce</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste. Be sure to taste the sauce first as soy sauce and red chilli sauce already have salt in them.</li>
        <li>Mix very well and simmer till the sauce has slightly thickened and the cornstarch has cooked.</li>
    </ol>
